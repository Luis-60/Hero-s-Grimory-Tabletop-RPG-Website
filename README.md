This is a project by Luis Carlos (me) and my university group. It was made for those who like virtual tabletop RPGs based on Dungeons and Dragons. 

We are just amateurs cursing our fourth period in the Informational Systems on Universidade Dom Bosco, and we don't aspire to take out popular VTTs like R20, Fantasy Ground, and others. We just search for what makes learning easy because RPGs require a lot of reading and studying. But with this, we reach for the facility.

As a quick reminder, those are the GitHub pages of every developer that collaborates on the code.

We can even modify this README in the future.
